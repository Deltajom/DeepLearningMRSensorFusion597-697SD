# DeepLearningMRSensorFusion597-697SD
This repository is to be used for collaboration between group members in the 597/697SD course, working on a sensor fusion project involving deep learning on the Hololens 2 AR headset.

# Extended Kalman Filter
The EKF_final.py is the Extended Kalman Filter to processing IMU tracking. Before run this code, edit the data_receiver function to modify the name of the dataset. It will return the 3-D model of IMU tracking.

EKF_Draft.py and EKF_Keras.py are codes we tried to use DNN but failed.
